 ## Researcher ##

### In the Spring of 2017, I received my Associate’s Degree in Information Technology from NVCC. I am in my final month at GMU pursuing a Bachelor’s Degree in Information Technology with a concentration in Information Security. I am also taking the required classes in order to receive the NSA/DHS Center of Academic Excellence in Information Assurance/Cyber Defense Education Criteria Certificate. ###

### I have an array of skills that I have acquired from my classes. They include Java programming, mySQL, networking, network security, security administration of Linux systems, PHP, website development, OS fundamentals, computer forensics, risk management, human computer interaction (HCI), PowerPoint presentations, team coordination and cooperation, MS Office, and critical thinking. ###

### I have begun studying for the Security + certification and I am willing to learn new skills and earn other certifications, not only for self-improvement but to increase my competency in my career. Also, I find I can work well with various personalities. ###

### In addition, I previously attended the University of Nebraska-Lincoln for three semesters, from 1990-1991, as a French language major and I speak a little Spanish. ###
