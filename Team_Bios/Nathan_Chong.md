### Hi! My name is Nathan and I will be completing my B.S. Degree in IT with a concentration in Database Technology & Programming this coming May. I transferred to GMU from Northern Virginia Community College in Spring 2018, and I will be starting a Software Developer/Consultant position with CGI this coming September. ###

I am well-versed in object-oriented programming, data structures and algorithms, web design fundamentals, form processing, XML/JSON generation and cloud architecture (AWS). ###
