Hi! My name is Nathan and I will be completing my B.S. Degree in IT with a concentration in Database Technology & Programming this coming May. I transferred to GMU from Northern Virginia Community College in Spring 2018, and I will be starting a Software Developer/Consultant position with CGI this coming September.

I have experience coding with Java and HTML as well as Microsoft Office suite.

I'm honored to be working with Applied Research Associates for my Senior Capstone Project.
