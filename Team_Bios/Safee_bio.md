Hello! My name is Safee and I'm an IT professional who will receive his Bachelor of Science in Information Technology with a concentration in Database Technology & Programming this Spring. I transferred from Northern Virginia Community College in 2017, and was formerly the IT Help Desk Intern at the International Association of Chiefs of Police from Fall 2019 until Spring of 2020. 

I have experience coding with Java, Python, and HTML, and hold sufficient knowledge of SQL. I have excellent working proficiency with the Microsoft Office suite, and have fair working experience with MySQL. In my internship I primarily worked with tracking of IT resources using AssetTiger, as well as performing data cleanup in Salesforce. 

I've been comfortable using computers for the past decade, and have sufficient PC troubleshooting skills, including hardware, software, and OS installation. I've recently been working with Linux OS, using Kali and Ubuntu for my security class to install a working LAMP stack. I like to think that I'm a pretty fast typer. 

In my free time I like to watch a lot of YouTube and anime, and play competetitive games with friends. 

I'm excited to be working with the Applied Research Associates for my senior capstone project, and hope to deliver the best possible solution.
