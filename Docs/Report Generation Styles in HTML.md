#### **Plotly/Dash**

Dash is a Python framework created by Plotly that is used for data analysis and for rendering analytic results in a web browser. It is cross-platform and shared through URLs. It is a free, open-source library but for the average user. The displays and tools seem detailed and rich in 3-D, which are great presentations of the data being manipulated, but the Dash Enterprise Cloud will start at $50,000.

#### **Pandas** 

A free software library used for data analysis and data manipulation using Python, Cython and C. It is cross-platform and can be used on any OS. Numpy is required before pandas can be installed. The output is 2-dimensional, but organized, color-coded, and a good representation of the data being analyzed. It is used in various organizations, such as Finance, Advertising, Statistics, Neuroscience, etc.

**Uses\:**

-Date/time stamps, date range and frequency conversion

-data manipulation with integrated indexing              

-Specifying data search, averages, and other calculations 

-Computing and plotting data on a graph in a couple of commands

-Concatenating data to create tables

-Search for missing data values 

-SQL “groupby” operations and then plot on graphs, also “merge” and “join” operations

The link below gives installation instructions, along with a 10-minute tutorial by the author of “Python for Data Analysis,” Wes Mckinney.

#### **PyHTML**

I also found this very simple HTML generator using Python, but I do not know if it will be useful. It may be too simple. Here is the link, though:
