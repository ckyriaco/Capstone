The **Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification or CMMC** is a framework developed by the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition & Sustainment (OUSD(A&S)), DoD stakeholders, University  Affiliated Research Centers and Federally Funded Research and Development Centers and industry.        
The CMMC maps controls and processes from various cybersecurity standards and best practices to best fit the range of security maturity levels from basic to advanced. Regardless of the level of security maturity, the CMMC mapped controls and processes will protect against a specific group of cyber threats.       
CMMC adds an additional verification component to existing cybersecurity regulations, specifically DFARS 252.204-7012.       
CMMC is designed to be low cost and easy to implement for small businesses with weaker security maturity levels.       
CMMC assessments will be conducted by Third Party Assessment Organizations that are authorized to issue CMMC certificates specifically to Defense Industrial Base companies at their corresponding security maturity level.

# CMMC Framework Certification Levels 
* **Level 1:** Companies must use antivirus software and ensure that employees change passwords regularly to protect Federal Contract Information (FCI)
* **Level 2:** Companies must document measures taken to protect Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) in accordance with  NIST 800-171 r2 requirements 
* **Level 3:** Companies must have an implemented management plan to protect Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) in accordance with NIST 800-171 r2 requirements as well as some additional protection standards.
* **Level 4:** Companies must have review processes in place to measure the effectiveness of their cyber hygene practices as well as processes in place to deal with advanced persistent threats(APTs) that continually undergo tactical, technical and procedural changes.
* **Level 5:** Companies must have standardized their cyber hygene processes organization-wide and have implemented more advanced and sophisticated processes to combat advanced persistent threats(APTs)

# History of CMMC and why it is being implemented
* DoD faces data breaches
* NIST requirements created 
* slow adoption
* CMMC mandated to protect Controlled Unclassified Information on contractor systems
* Only DoD suppliers that only provide commercial off-the-shelf products are excluded from the audit

# Notes on NIST 800-171 Compliance
* Need a system security plan and a plan of action
* Configure environment for compliance
* Build budget for compliance and perhaps outsource
