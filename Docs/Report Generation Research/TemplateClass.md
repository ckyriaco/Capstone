## String Template Class

* Built-in to the String module in Python
* Creates simplified syntax for output specification, using placeholder names formed by $ with valid Python identifiers (alphanumeric characters and underscores)
* Created by passing the template string to its constructor, which supports $-based substitutions with 2 key methods:
    * substitute(mapping, **kwds): This method performs substitutions using a dictionary with a process similar to key-based mapping objects. keyword arguments can also be used for the same purpose. In case the key-based mapping and the keyword arguments have the same key, it throws a TypeError. If keys are missing it returns a KeyError.
    * substitute(mapping, **kwds): The behaviour of this method is similar to that of the substitute method but it doesnâ€™t throw a KeyError if a key is missing, rather it returns placeholder in the result string.
* The substitute() method raises a KeyError when a placeholder isn't supplied in a dictionary or a keyword argument
* Best used when handling formatted strings generated by users of your program
* Other string formatting techniques can introduce security vulnerabilities; if a malicious user can supply a format string, they can potentially leak secret keys and other sensitive information
* Template strings don't allow for format specifiers - need to manually transform int number into a hex-string
