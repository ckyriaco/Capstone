# Task Completion #

## Notice: ##

### - All tasks are to be completed by 11:59pm on the Saturday of the week that the task was assigned. Failure to complete the task, without a valid excuse, will be recorded and be subject to further discussion. If two tasks in a row are missed, a group discussion will be conducted, and the teammate that missed the tasks will have to explain why they were unable to complete the tasks. A third missed assignment will warrant the consequence of having Professor McLaughlin informed of the missed assignments. Further action will be at the discretion of Professor McLaughlin. ###

## Steps for Task Completion ##

### 1. Complete all tasks assigned to you at the beginning of the week. ###
### 2. Inform the group leader for review. ###
### 3. If satisfactory, the task will be checked off the list. Otherwise, the group leader will identify what adjustments are needed in order to consider the task completed. ###

### If you have any questions, please feel free to contact the group leader at anytime. ###
