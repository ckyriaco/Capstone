# Task Completion #

## Notice: ##

All tasks are to be completed by 11:59pm on the Saturday of the week that the task was assigned. Failure to complete the task, without a valid excuse, will be recorded and be subject to further discussion. If two tasks in a row are missed, a group discussion will be conducted and the team will discuss how the teammatate will make up for the missed assignments. At a minimum, the teammate will have to complete the work they did not complete if it was not completed by another teammate due to a deadline looming. If another teammate completed a task for the teammate that missed multiple assignments, the teammate that did not complete their work will have to complete an equal amount of tasks for the teammate that covered for them. A third missed assignment will warrant the consequence of having Professor McLaughlin informed of the missed assignments. Further action will be at the discretion of Professor McLaughlin. 

## Steps for Task Completion ##

### 1. Complete all tasks assigned to you at the beginning of the week. ###
### 2. Inform the group leader for review. ###
### 3. If satisfactory, the task will be checked off the list. Otherwise, the group leader will identify what adjustments are needed in order to consider the task completed. ###

### If you have any questions, please feel free to contact the group leader at anytime. ###
