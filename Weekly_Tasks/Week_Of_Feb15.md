## Tasks ##

### Whole Team ###


- [X] Everyone will look through the new changes to the code and write down their interpretation of what the code is doing. This is a macro level overview of what is going on. This is to make sure everyone is understanding what the code is doing prior to our meeting with Dr. Ingham.
- [X] Based on what you saw in the prototype and your research so far, document down any questions you may have about the project going forward. These questions will be addressed at our group meeting and meeting with Dr. Ingham.
- [X] Complete you blockchain paper by the 17th!


### Dave Fuller ###

- [X] Research common vulnerabilities within Active Directory
- [X] For each vulnerability, research if there is or isn't a known prevention method. If there is, specify what the standard prevention is.
- [X] Research possible report generation styles for our prototype under the direction of Safee. (Safee: Dave, look into report generating in python using Excel; Pandas library + xlsxwriter / xlwings?)
- [X] Do documentation assigned to you by Nathan (Nathan: Please document Active_Directory_Audit.py)

### Christopher Kyriacou ###

- [X] Work on improving prototype (Specifically the remediation script and possibly looking into have an audit and remediation option without port scanner as an option).
- [X] Comment new code so Nathan can add to documentation.

### Nathan Chong ###

- [X] Work on adding documentation on new code (Nathan: I will be documenting ADaudit.py)
- [X] Assign documentation of code
- [X] Work on report style research assigned to you by Safee. (Safee: Nathan, look into generating text reports in python into PDF format; Pandas library + ReportLab?)

### Jamie Sutton ### 

- [X] Research possible report generation styles for our prototype under the direction of Safee. (Safee: Jamie, look into report generating in python via HTML; Pandas library + HTML / Plotly Dash?)
- [X] Document code assigned to you by nathan. (Nathan: Please document Active_Directory_Remediation.py)

### Safee Ghafoori ###
 
- [X] Research possible report generation styles that may you feel may be a good choice for displaying the results of our findings. Find out which ones you deem are worth a look and delignate the research between you, Nathan, Dave and Jamie. Everyone must list out the pros and cons of using each. (Safee: Will look into Template class and better formatting of the text report)
- [X] Assign Research
- [X] Document code to you assigned to you by nathan. (Nathan: Please document Naming_Convention.py and any further changes (if any) to Port_Scanner.py)
