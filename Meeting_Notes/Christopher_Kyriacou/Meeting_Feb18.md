# Meeting Feb 18 #

- Discussed desire for addition of psexec funtion to run netstat -ban on server from remote host.
- Also, wants the days since last admin logon to show.
- Dr. Ingham is impressed with our progress. 
- Use of sysinternal tools for re-occuring netstat -ban will be looked into by Dr. Ingham. But as long as psexec is funcitoning, the execution of that will be simple to do once he has decided which funciton he wants.
