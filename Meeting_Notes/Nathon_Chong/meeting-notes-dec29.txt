all start research about openscap  and active directory
select a target host and perform a scan based on remediation 
tech to weight against nist standards 
open source tool managed by nist
workbench software application 
red hat company 
maps 

red-hat-linux-7 
rel7

specify how things happen
make sure its built correctly

acible automation language

use powershell
use workbench
ssg chromium scap workbench
tool that the govt gives to ppl for free to make sure they are compliant 
change the standards randomly
governance regulations
some of them cant get automated
monitoring idle accounts 
they are asking us to reinvent the wheel 
we dont know how we can integrate our solution into what they are using 
more powerful command line 
running commands 
we cant access their active 
access through the school 
completely build a complete system 
imitating the mock directory
not sure if the school has open servers around
theyre getting rid of tenable 
revitazing how they do their fedramp compliance 
fedramp tools 
secure coding 
two week background check on us 
making our own mock server for testing in linux 
what are the processes that they are using to make active directory
there are a big companies like red hat that already make the things that CGI is asking us for 
need a CS guy to talk to us and tell 
us 
what are the problems that youre running into 
how is 
we dont need to need to build and implement system ourselves 
we can research what they need to do instead
what are they using to automatically script these checks 
script that automates 
better than attempting to make a mock system that probably wont replicate what they are working with 
we need to decide if it is worth it to work with ARA or go with Chris's dad's company (build a local host database, form to fill in information on each job that was completed, open source tools, right now he is using paper and pencil)
