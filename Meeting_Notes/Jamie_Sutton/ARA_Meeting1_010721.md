**ARA Meeting** 

**POC-Dr. Kenneth Ingham**

**01/07/21**

 

ARA’s goal of CMMC Level 3 compliance

- would not pass right now



Have list of requirements by Dr. Ingham

 

Current auditing of AD (Active Directory) is weak—monthly, if that

- not enough manpower

- need better system of auditing (automation), currently manual

- need to show assessor their procedures for compliance

- may change from Tenable to Qualys in future, but > 6 months

- need interim system until changeover—cheap or open source

 

Current users include 1500 employees, 100 admin

 

Current user accounts:

- us.ARA.com (every employee)

- restrict.ARA.com (contractors, non-US citizens, etc.)

- admin.ARA.com (very few people have this level of access)

 

Will not be able to access internal systems due to sensitive info:

- so, create mock AD system to mirror ARA’s AD

- may be able to use RSA tokens expiring in April for practice
