meeting start 2:00pm  
markdown tutorial  
weekly tasks  
NIST research  
Level 3 practices (focus)   
study all levels  
research multiple sites on CMMC  
looks really good potential employer    
document as throughly as you can     
the scripts documentation will be read by Dr Ingham!  
gifs dont work in a pdf  
presentations folder  
professor doesnt want access to our github anymore  
markdown is easy to use   
mostly just formatting for businesss purposes   
pdf powerpoint presentation in Docs    
bash diagram    
bash scripts   
we are using gitbash  
converts stuff and executible   
can be used in a VM  
upload changes from VM to github really quick  
bash file is executable in a specific folder  
python passing variables secure scripts need bash files that passes credentials into script   
script compromised ok because all names are not accesable   
gitignore is a way to protect confidential info  
secure and executable   
easy to automate  
bash file executes   
script progress is going well 5/7  
naming nomanclature is ambigiuous  
thursday need more prompt responses from dr ingham    
we have a prototype   
port mapping older than    
manipulated code   
code uses os itself   
damen mode    
port has to be active and running    
during scan   
weird port issue  
code damen mode    
telnet spoof just a web server    
scanner saw port list not updated   
port number scan   
look at the output    
indicates server    
KTG local    
one client pc   
chris's local desktop    
script scans for was currently running on the port    
it shows you what should be running or preset    
chris's code shows what is actively running    
a scan could potentially 10 - 20 mins to an hour or more     
because of the scanning of all the ports   
that is a scaling issue    
would be better query everything separately    
work issues for team accountability     
team numerous tasks    
it also looks good to ara    
we can help each to make these deadlines    
3rd time in a row missed assignments     
accountability plan    
objections to accountability plan?
good because it lays out what exactly the team expectations are    
and what needs to be completed each week     
chris and dr ingham will be evaluating each action of contractors    
documentation not have to be perfect    
do your best to understand everything    
1-2 hours or so researching or 30 min researching    
documentation is pretty good    
113 page documents about CMMC audit    
process and practices    
quite a few    
understand NIST and CMMC    
understand it at a high level and things that you think we need to know    
let team leader know if you think tasks are unfair   
get these tasks out of the way in the beginning of the semester   
will prob get easier further along the semester    
we need to maintain our lead in front of the other groups    
how much can we do for the client     
dr ingham github no access yet   
he has no issues with python    
as long as we get the info that he wants    
just need clarification of "naming conventions"     
safee share his documentation on port scanner  
chris was working on     
port scanner documentation explanation
warning has a catcher    
also future warning    
docuemntation is just brief explanation of what the code is doing    
identifying what ports are open and what is running on those ports    
any abnormal activity on ports?    
file?? f = open file      
which ports are open and what is running    
apending the file with new content     
when function is done you can retrieve info from a text file     
scripts working pretty well    
port scan executed within port status method yes    
exceeded expectations     
port status method    
id what we are looking at     
socket threading and time    
and queue    
the threader takes in inputs for the inputs    
for every ip    
pass in the port    
way to run through the operating system    
q.task    
threaders targeting this function to pass through       
all questions answered

meeting end 3:18 pm
