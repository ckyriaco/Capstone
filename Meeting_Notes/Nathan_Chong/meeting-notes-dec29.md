all start research about openscap  and active directory  
select a target host and perform a scan based on remediation   
tech to weight against nist standards   
open source tool managed by nist  
workbench software application   
red hat company   
maps   
  
red-hat-linux-7   
rel7  

specify how things happen  
make sure its built correctly  

acible automation language  

use powershell  
use workbench  
ssg chromium scap workbench  
tool that the govt gives to ppl for free to make sure they are compliant   
change the standards randomly  
governance regulations  
some of them cant get automated  
monitoring idle accounts   
they are asking us to reinvent the wheel   
we dont know how we can integrate our solution into what they are using   
more powerful command line   
running commands   
we cant access their active   
access through the school   
completely build a complete system   
imitating the mock directory  
not sure if the school has open servers around  
theyre getting rid of tenable   
revitazing how they do their fedramp compliance   
fedramp tools   
secure coding   
two week background check on us   
making our own mock server for testing in linux   
what are the processes that they are using to make active directory  
there are a big companies like red hat that already make the things that   CGI is asking us for   
need a CS guy to talk to us and tell   
us   
what are the problems that youre running into   
how is   
we dont need to need to build and implement system ourselves   
we can research what they need to do instead  
what are they using to automatically script these checks   
script that automates   
better than attempting to make a mock system that probably wont replicate what they are working with   
we need to decide if it is worth it to work with ARA or go with Chris's dad's company (build a local host database, form to fill in information on each job that was completed, open source tools, right now he is using paper and pencil)
