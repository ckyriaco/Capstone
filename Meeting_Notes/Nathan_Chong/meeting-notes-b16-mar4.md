**meeting start 3:06pm**        
csv vs excel   
Audit_Report.csv explanation    
code reuse    
gitbash pull out os   
logical overview   
we use bash scripts bc we want to make sure that info is not exposed   
pass in data   
encrypt bash script   
pypsexec    
username is cached??    
pass in name of computer name    
trying to make anyone who intercepts the scripts blind to the data    
ADaudit uses credentials to audit AD    
port scanner does the same thing    
netstat commands   
gather information to retrieve info and do simple remediation    
ask to change passwords near the end of the process    
because script checks if the user has an expired password   
and may boot out the user if he has an expired password    
ara only wants to audit not remediate    
but they may be forced to automatically remediate in the future     
chris's boss wanted to make customizable programs but manpower intensive    
just use something that gets the job done      
safee make a diagram for netstat activities    
return to the remote pc    
show the prototypes to show where we are   
minute long gifs to demo scripts    
netstat ban screenshot   
some info is NA or not available    
hardware software personnel limitations    
will require professional grade laptop and industry grade server    
port scanner takes the longest time      
dont want to use a vm to do this    
ARA already has the needed resources      
they have to download all the packages    
maybe in a container      
need to be able to run python     
standard grade computer at ara (i7 and 12g of ram)      
you could be remediating things     
ara has plenty of resources    
1 person could do all of this    
without scripts you would have to manually sift through all audit info    
it would take years     
Almost finished with project, just need to polish
