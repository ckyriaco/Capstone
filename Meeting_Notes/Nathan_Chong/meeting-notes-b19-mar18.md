ara estimates      
it seemed like dr ingham understood last time we met      
but that was not the case         
he seemed to be proficient in linux bash      
we just did a paper on blockchains       
he wants instructions ahead of schedule      
he starting to implement the scripts        
we were not on the same page schedule wise       
instructions can refer to stuff already documented like basic python features       
dod audit is cmmc audit         
this project is for the dod by extension        
there may have been a security incident that triggered the dod audit        
he was trying to run the software on linux      
but he did tell us to build something that would run on windows      
so never make assumptions and make instructions early       
those variables are generic active directory terms     
add link to generic active directory info       
he didnt know what win32 or win64 was or that you cant run it on linux??             
we shouldn't assume someone's knowledge base     
gulf war briefing in germany     
collapse of soviet union      
he was trying run win32 on ubuntu        
learn a good lesson to document everything more clearly        
readme installation instructions      
includes steps and steps within steps         
ensure win7 8 10 installed        
prior instructions       
make sure you have pandas numpy python        
chris was working with an extremely strict Silicon Valley developer      
"you should be able to see what packages should be installed or you shouldnt be in the room with me"
jamies presentation       
never asssume common sense will prevail       
never assume the guy who made the car will know how to enter the car          
ara is apprehensive about automated remediation        
just focus on the actual audit          
prompt for signin????        
our script has operating system handle admin signin so no credentials have to be shown       
password has to be kept hidden and secured by windows operating system instead of python scripts       
you're not signing in the actual script with RSA and password.        
using classes       
executable as bash script or have it in plain text        
the location of where users are stored in Active Directory is sensitive info according to Microsoft        
how gitbash executes encrypted scripts???       
you could have bash scripts execute away from the folder?         
chris has contacts that know how that works from previous employment
