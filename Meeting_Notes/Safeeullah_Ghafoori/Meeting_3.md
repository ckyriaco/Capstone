# ARA Meeting 3 notes
* What kind of naming convention(s) does ARA use for their users / computers?
    * _They use a specific naming convention for both users / computers; most of company follows that convention_
* ARA runs Windows "Run-As..."; don't tend to login as Administrator itself
* Dr. Ingham has two accounts: a regular account without special privileges, and one that actually makes changes / requires higher privilges 
    * Need to have script set so that an ARA user account (without higher privileges) can run the script as an admin (through something like Windows' "Run-As...")
* Suggestions for formatting of the text report?
    *  _None at the moment_
