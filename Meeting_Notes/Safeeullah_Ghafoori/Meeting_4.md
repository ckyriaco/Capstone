## ARA Meeting 4

* Port Scanner needs changes
    * Want to know if somebody else (outside entity) is connecting into the server, and be able to do this remotely
    * Need to find something as robust as netstat -ban 
* Suggest we have code check and see if script is running as an admin
* For admin last login, include how long ago the actual last logon was, not just a time stamp
* ARA security team likely won't be doing the remediation; system admins will be performing audit, and be able to tell security team what remediations need to occur
* Security team will be the ones most likely to use the code
* ARA runs internal time synchronization (all computers need to be synchronized)
