# ARA Meeting 1 notes
* must meet CMMC certification (will be audited for these procedures) - a superset of NIST 
* can't get access to some data that needs to be audited 
* CMMC isn't a configuration requirement - more so practices 
* Openscap is a "pain" - openscap doesn't have CMMC compliance tools
* the processes suggested for us to tackle are either fully manual or not done 
* they want us to at least give them a starting point for automation - don't need to automate every process they suggested for us 
* currently using AD for Linux authentication (they use linux for AD, and servers / development systems)
* Dr Ingham is the lead for cybersecurity for ARA 
* currently uses Tenable, they may switch to Kualas in the near future 
* must pass CMMC level 3 assessment 
* RSA token from Chris Prather? 
* ARA is looking into Ansible, might use Ansible Salt
