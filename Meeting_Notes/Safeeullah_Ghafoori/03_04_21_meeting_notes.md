## 03/04/21 Meeting 

- CSV has specified info separated by commas
	- usually going to be working with one large data frame which will be used as a table; in our case we have multiple dataframes 
- our procedural script may not be used by ARA exactly as how we have it, but we focused on reusability of the classes
- goal in our approach to the solution was a modern, secure solution - ARA initially wanted Powershell script, we instead went with Python
