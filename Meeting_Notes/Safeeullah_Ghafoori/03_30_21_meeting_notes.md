- encryption / decryption process 
	- using makefiles; allow you to create functions to be performed procedurally; usually built for linux systems, but we are running them through Windows 
	- utilizing makefiles to encrypt and decrypt bash files we are using; removing the plaintext when encrypting
	- good security hygiene is to remove the decrypted files (the audit and remediate files) after execution 
- documentation step; don't need it to be in depth - macro explanation 
- Solution sustainment / next steps: providing ARA a simple, straightforward documentation on what to do next, and maintain the code going forward
	- open-source solution, which isn't complex in nature, and is very simple to maintain, with a lot of documentation out there
